I have learned the lesson of
All that's foul and fair
Our love was forged in fire
Water, Earth and Air
The spell is cast, how long it lasts
I cannot divine
The road is there
And so I dare
To risk this heart of mine

Down, down, down the road
Down the Witches' Road
Down, down, down the road
Down the Witches' Road
Down, down, down the road
Down the Witches' Road
Follow me, my friend
To glory at the end

I have known the power
Of midnights in the wood
I've danced inside the circle of
All that's bad and good
The dangers great, the trials wait
For those who seek the prize
Tame your fears
A door appears
To love that never dies

As we go
Down, down, down the road
Down the Witches' Road
Down, down, down the road
Down the Witches' Road
Down, down, down the road
Down the Witches' Road
Blood and tears and bone
Together and alone

If I can't reach you
Let my song teach you
All you need to keep our love alive
If I can't hold you
Remember what I told you
It's the only way we survive
We survive

The road is wild and wicked
Winding out of time
Still we face our fortune
Chasing the sublime
What's lost is found, what's fierce is bound
We're broken and we're burned
But take a breath
And dance with death
My love cannot be turned

As we go
Down, down, down the road
Down the Witches' Road
Down, down, down the road
Down the Witches' Road
Down, down, down the road
Down the Witches' Road
Wherever it may bend
I'll see you at the end
I'll see you at the end
I'll see you at the end
I'll see you at the end
I'll see you at the end
